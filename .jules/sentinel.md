## 2026-04-16 - Unauthenticated Database Upload
**Vulnerability:** The `main/upload_db.php` script allowed unauthenticated users to upload and overwrite the entire SQLite database file (`database.sqlite`).
**Learning:** Admin endpoints and critical data manipulation scripts must be guarded with session validation and role checks. Leaving maintenance scripts open is a critical threat.
**Prevention:** Always verify `$_SESSION['user_id']` and confirm the user's role against the database before executing any administrative action or file upload processing.

## 2024-04-16 - Hardcoded Secrets
**Vulnerability:** Hardcoded API keys in `main/cloudinary.php` and plaintext passwords in `main/gensql.php`.
**Learning:** Hardcoded credentials can easily leak and compromise the entire system.
**Prevention:** Rely on environment variables for API keys and remove setup scripts containing sensitive test/init data from the production codebase.
